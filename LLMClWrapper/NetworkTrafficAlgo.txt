1.Token Bucket algorithm
  -Token Generation: Tokens are added to the bucket at a constant, fixed rate (e.g., 5 tokens per second).
  -Capacity: The bucket has a maximum size. If the bucket is full, new tokens are discarded.
  -Processing: Every time a request (or packet) comes in, it must "grab" a token from the bucket to be processed.
  -The "Burst": If the bucket is full because no requests have happened for a while, a large "burst" of requests can all be processed instantly until the bucket is empty. Once empty, the system must wait for new tokens to generate.

2. Leaky Bucket
Think of this as a bucket with a small hole in the bottom. No matter how much water (requests) you pour in at once, the water only drips out the bottom at a constant, steady rate.

Key Difference: Unlike Token Bucket, it does not allow for bursts. It forces a perfectly smooth flow of traffic.

Similar to Token bucket, the Leaky Bucket also doesn't store the timestamp of every single request, instead, it:
  -Calculate the Leak: Based on time_passed, "leak" (remove) water from the bucket.
  -Add: Try to add 1 unit of "water" (the new request) to the bucket.
  -Check: If the bucket overflows, the request is discarded. If it fits, the request is processed at the steady output rate.
  -Update: Set last_update_time = current_time.

3. Fixed Window Counter
The simplest method. It tracks the number of requests within a fixed timeframe (e.g., "100 requests per minute"). Once you hit 100, you are blocked until the next minute starts.

Downside: It can suffer from "boundary spikes." If a user sends 100 requests at 10:00:59 and another 100 at 10:01:01, they technically sent 200 requests in two seconds, even though they stayed within the "per minute" limit.

4. Sliding Window Log
This tracks a timestamp for every single request. When a new request comes in, the system looks back at the last 60 seconds of history and counts the timestamps.

Key Advantage: It is extremely accurate and prevents boundary spikes.

Downside: It is memory-heavy because you have to store every single timestamp.

5.. Sliding Window Counter
A hybrid between Fixed Window and Sliding Window Log. It uses a formula to estimate the number of requests in the current window based on the previous window's count. It’s memory-efficient but slightly less precise than the Log method.
